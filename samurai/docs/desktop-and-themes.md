# Samurai KDE Plasma and Design System

> **Implemented today:** Kuro and Shiro KDE color schemes (`.colors`) installed
> system-wide and per user, a full set of Samurai wallpapers in
> `/usr/share/backgrounds/samurai/`, the branded Calamares welcome slide, and
> the `samurai-theme` CLI that applies colors *and* wallpaper (with an optional
> systemd user timer). Custom icon sets, cursors, and login-screen branding are
> **not included yet**.

## Wallpapers

The image ships 22 wallpapers in `/usr/share/backgrounds/samurai/`, generated
from the Samurai art collection with `build/make-wallpapers.py`:

- `kuro.jpg` and `shiro.jpg` are the theme defaults. `samurai-theme` applies
  the one matching the selected theme with `plasma-apply-wallpaperimage`, and
  the Plasma autostart entry runs `samurai-theme default` on first login, so the
  live session and freshly installed systems both start with Kuro colors and
  the moonlit wallpaper.
- Portrait sources are placed, fit to full height, over a blurred copy of
  themselves; landscape sources are scaled and centre-cropped to 1920x1080, so
  nothing is distorted.
- The other 20 wallpapers (`crimson-moon.jpg`, `moonlit-tree.jpg`, ...) are
  available in the Plasma wallpaper picker.

Regenerate after changing the source art (requires Pillow):

```bash
python3 build/make-wallpapers.py
```

The generated files are committed, so ISO builds do not need Pillow.

## Theme Selector
- **Persistent theme selector** in System Settings -> Appearance
- **CLI selector** - `samurai-theme kuro|shiro|list|status|wallpaper|random`
- **Auto mode** - `samurai-theme auto` switches at 06:00 and 18:00
- **Persistent auto mode** - `samurai-theme install-auto` installs a systemd user timer
- **Wallpapers** - Samurai art collection (22 pieces) from the project, auto-applied per theme or manually selectable
- **Contrast testing** - palette values target WCAG AA for body text
- **Focus states** - crimson/gold focus indicators defined in both schemes
- **Application behavior** - still needs testing against real KDE applications

## Installation Artwork
- **Wallpapers** - 22 Samurai wallpapers shipped in the ISO (see above)
- **Logos** - Samurai crest with Japanese calligraphy elements
- **Icons** - Consistent design language across themes (icon set pending)
- **Terminal colors** - Both Kuro and Shiro schemes
- **Login branding** - Samurai logo at login screen (pending)
- **Installer artwork** - Calamares uses the Samurai branding component with a
  branded welcome slide (`/etc/calamares/branding/samurai/slide1.png`)
