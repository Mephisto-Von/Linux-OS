# Samurai Linux

A Debian-based operating system combining AI-assisted computing, software development,
cybersecurity, gaming, daily desktop productivity, privacy, and high performance.

- **Base**: Debian Stable (Trixie)
- **Desktop**: KDE Plasma
- **Themes**: Kuro (Dark, `#111214`) and Shiro (Light, `#F5F0E6`) KDE color
  schemes, with a Japanese Samurai-inspired palette (crimson and gold accents).
  Wallpapers, icons, and cursors are planned.

## Quick Start

### Themes
```bash
samurai-theme kuro     # Apply dark theme
samurai-theme shiro     # Apply light theme
samurai-theme auto      # Time-of-day automatic switching
samurai-theme list      # List available themes
```

### AI Assistant
```bash
samurai-ai chat "Hello"           # Chat with the default model
samurai-ai install-model <id>     # Pull a model via Ollama
samurai-ai delete-model <id>      # Remove a local model
samurai-ai list-models            # List installed models
samurai-ai set-default <model>    # Set the default model
samurai-ai get-default            # Print the default model
samurai-ai configure --model <id> --install   # Set and pull a model
samurai-ai status                 # Inference and credential status
samurai-ai gpu-info               # GPU detection
samurai-ai cpu-info               # CPU detection
samurai-ai memory-budget          # RAM and suggested AI budget
samurai-ai check-compatibility <id>  # Estimate whether a model fits
samurai-ai credentials get|set|remove <provider> [key]  # Secret Service / 0600 fallback
```

### Gaming
```bash
samurai-gaming install-profile   # Install Steam, Proton, GameMode, MangoHUD
samurai-gaming steam             # Launch Steam with MangoHUD
samurai-gaming lutris            # Launch Lutris with MangoHUD
```

## Building the ISO

The build uses Debian's `live-build`; the old hand-written `debootstrap` +
`xorriso` recipe was invalid and has been replaced. See
[`build/README.md`](build/README.md) for the full guide.

### Build host requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Debian 13 (Trixie) | Debian 13 |
| Free disk | 50 GB | 100 GB |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| Architecture | x86_64 | x86_64 |
| Tools | `live-build`, `debootstrap`, `xorriso`, `squashfs-tools` | + QEMU, GNUPG |

### Build and test

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y live-build debootstrap xorriso squashfs-tools gnupg

# Build the ISO and collect it under dist/
sudo bash build/build.sh

# Optional: sign it (SAMURAI_SIGN_KEY is your GPG key id)
sudo -E SAMURAI_SIGN_KEY="<key-id>" bash build/build.sh

# Boot-test in QEMU
bash build/qemu-test.sh dist/samurai-linux-*-amd64.iso --gui
```

Output: `dist/samurai-linux-YYYY.MM.DD-amd64.iso`, its `.sha256`, and an
armored detached `.sig` when signing is enabled.

> Build on a Linux filesystem, not on `/mnt/c` or `/mnt/d` under WSL.

## Current Status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Architecture & design documentation | ✅ Complete (aspirational in places) |
| Kuro / Shiro KDE `.colors` schemes | ✅ Implemented; wallpapers/icons/cursors pending |
| `samurai-ai` CLI | ✅ Implemented, smoke-tested |
| `samurai-theme` CLI | ✅ Applies real KDE color schemes |
| `samurai-gaming` CLI | ✅ Fixed for Debian (Steam via `steam-installer`) |
| `live-build` ISO pipeline | ✅ Scaffolded; CI job validates config |
| CI (ShellCheck + smoke tests) | ✅ Workflow included (not yet run on GitHub) |
| Bootable ISO boot-tested | ⚠️ Not yet run in this repository |
| Calamares installer / first boot | ❌ Not implemented |
| Signed APT repository | ❌ Not implemented |

`RELEASE_DESCRIPTION.md` is retained as a historical build log. Its commands are
superseded by `build/README.md` and should not be used.

## Post-Build Tooling

```bash
# Analyze a built ISO with REA
./scripts/analyze-iso.sh path/to/samurai.iso

# Run the combined post-build workflow (REA + Heretic)
./scripts/post-build-workflow.sh path/to/samurai.iso

# Decensor a model with Heretic (requires: pip install heretic-llm)
python3 scripts/use-heretic.py google/gemma-3-12b-it
```

## Testing

```bash
# ShellCheck + CLI smoke tests (Debian container in CI)
bash tests/smoke.sh
```

The workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same checks in a
`debian:trixie` container and validates the live-build configuration.
